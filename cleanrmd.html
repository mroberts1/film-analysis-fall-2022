<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>This course is designed to equip students with the tools necessary to
become critically aware and capable film viewers by introducing elements
of film form, processes of textual analysis, a variety of cinematic
techniques used in narrative and non-narrative cinema, and other models
of critical analysis used in film criticism.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>After completing the course, students should have acquired the
following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to analyze technical/formal components of film narratives
(shot composition, cinematography, editing, use of color, sound,
narrative structure, genre, or style) as a path to understanding their
intended meanings</li>
<li>Basic understanding of major interpretative frameworks by which film
narratives can be analyzed and ability to apply one or more of these
frameworks to the analysis of specific film narratives</li>
<li>Understanding of methodological and stylistic differences between
forms of writing about film, including movie reviews, critical essays,
theoretical essays, fan discourse</li>
<li>Ability to deploy the above analytical skills in critical essays
that analyze the meaning of films as cultural texts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="class-format">Class format</h2>
<p>Beginning in Week 2, each class session will be divided into two
halves, with a short break between each. In the first half, we’ll
discuss a chapter from Part One of the course textbook
(<strong>Technique &amp; Meaning</strong>); in the second half, we’ll
discuss a chapter from Part Three (<strong>Critical
Analysis</strong>).</p>
<p>Each week beginning in week 2, a group of three students will be
assigned to host a 30-minute discussion of the reading assignment in the
first half of class (i.e., there will be one group in the first half and
a different group in the second half). Group assignments are made
randomly.</p>
<p>Every third week, the first section of class will focus on one of the
five case study films from chapters 9-13 of the textbook (<strong>Close
Viewings</strong>). The second half of class will be a panel consisting
of 3 presentations (for details, see Assignments).</p>

<h2 id="policies-protocol">Policies &amp; Protocol</h2>
<p><strong>Attendance</strong> Since this class meets only weekly,
attendance is particularly important. Students are allowed one absence
per semester. Two absences will lower your final grade half a letter
grade. Three absences will lower your grade a whole letter grade. Any
more than <strong>three absences</strong>, regardless of the reason, and
students will have to withdraw from the course (in accordance with Keene
State College student handbook). Come and talk to me if you have any
problem in attending the class.</p>
<p>Keene State policy: A student who misses more than 3 weeks in the
first 10 weeks of the semester (regardless of the reason, including
excused absences and emergencies) must withdraw from the course. The
student must follow the regular withdrawal procedure. The complete KSC
attendance policy can be viewed at <a
href="http://www.keene.edu/registrar/policy/policy.cfm#6">http://www.keene.edu/registrar/policy/policy.cfm#6</a></p>

<hr />
<h2 id="discussion-participation">Discussion &amp; participation</h2>
<p>Class discussion (i.e. your participation) is one of the most
essential parts of this class. Please come to class fully prepared—both
intellectually and physically. Also keep in mind that we always need to
work together in order to create a productive and inspiring academic
environment by being polite and respectful toward other students’
comments and ideas. In order to ensure your full participation and
engagement in class, the use of laptops and/or mobile devices during
lectures, discussion, and screenings is not permitted.</p>

<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic honesty</h2>
<p>We understand and agree that we are participating in higher
education. We respect this process and will act as mature and
responsible individuals in it. To ensure that, all students are expected
to hand in original written work. Using other people’s words without
proper attribution constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism and any other
forms of cheating will result in an F for the assignment and may include
further College sanctions. In this class, every student must be aware of
and adhere to the college’s policy on academic honesty. Detailed
procedures and processes pertaining to the Policy on Academic Honesty
