### Class format
Begininng in Week 2, each class session will be divided into two halves, with a short break between each. In the first half, we'll discuss a chapter from Part One of the course textbook (**Techniques & Meaning**); in the second half, we'll discuss a chapter from Part Three (**Critical Analysis**). 

Each week beginning in week 2, a group of three students will be assigned to host a 30-minute discussion of the reading assignment in the first half of class (i.e., there will be one group in the first half and a different group in the second half). Group assignments are made randomly. 

Every third week, the first section of class will focus on one of the five case study films from chapters 9-13 of the textbook (**Close Viewings**). The second half of class will be a panel consisting of 3 presentations (for details, see Assignments).

### Policies & Protocol

Since this class meets only weekly, attendance is particularly important. Students are allowed one absence per semester. Two absences will lower your final grade half a letter grade. Three absences will lower your grade a whole letter grade. Any more than **three absences**, regardless of the reason, and students will have to withdraw from the course (in accordance with Keene State College student handbook). Come and talk to me if you have any problem in attending the class.

Keene State policy: A student who misses more than 3 weeks in the first 10 weeks of the semester (regardless of the reason, including excused absences and emergencies) must withdraw from the course. The student must follow the regular withdrawal procedure. The complete KSC attendance policy can be viewed at [http://www.keene.edu/registrar/policy/policy.cfm#6](http://www.keene.edu/registrar/policy/policy.cfm#6)

### Readings & assignments

----------

### Discussion & participation
Class discussion (i.e. your participation) is one of the most essential parts of this class. Please come to class fully prepared—both intellectually and physically. Also keep in mind that we always need to work together in order to create a productive and inspiring academic environment by being polite and respectful toward other students’ comments and ideas. In order to ensure your full participation and engagement in class, the use of laptops and/or mobile devices during lectures, discussion, and screenings is not permitted.

We understand and agree that we are participating in higher education. We respect this process and will act as mature and responsible individuals in it. To ensure that, all students are expected to hand in original written work. Using other people’s words without proper attribution constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism and any other forms of cheating will result in an F for the assignment and may include further College sanctions. In this class, every student must be aware of and adhere to the college’s policy on academic honesty.
